**Andra Florea, M.Sc.**

Professional ornithologist accumulating several experiences, I am also sensitive and involved in social and political issues. Active with the Oceanography Module Council, the Oceanography Program Committee, the feminist committee of the university, I also enjoy organizing events and music festivals. In lost time, I founded the page of the Regroupement des TechniciensNEs et Biologistes GraduéEs du Québec, a unique networking place, which I have administered since 2018 and which has more than 2,800 members. Equipped with a technique in bioecology from Cégep de Saint-Laurent, a bachelor's degree in biology (ecology) from the University of Quebec at Rimouski, I joined the Laboratory of Advanced Bioenergetics for a master's degree in Oceanography relating to an Iceland scallop (Chlamys islandica) fishery in Sanikiluaq, NU. To quantify and qualify the resource, many biometrics were measured on the scallops such as lipidic and protein content, calorimetry, age, size, meat yield, condition index for a future exploratory fishing permit. On the side, a modelling of the distribution of the scallop around the archipelago was made using knowledge from the fishers and data available on open databases. During my bachelor's degree, I carried out research on the foraging impact on oxidative stress for the northern gannet (Morus bassanus) from the Bonaventure Island colony. In addition, I have been working on a manuscript on the migratory phenology of Quebec birds for the past 50 years and just published an article about the irruptive migratory behavior of the White-breasted Nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis) in eastern North America. Currently, I am working as a professional ornithologist for Environmental and Climatic Change Canada doing pelagic seabird surveys.
